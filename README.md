# Weather Dashboard

This web Application was designed for travellers who are trying to plan their journey. It can be used to determine the weather in any city, including temperature, wind speed, and Humidity. It also displays this information for the following 5 days. It also makes use of dynamic buttons which are created as the user inputs more cities, creating a "History list" which can be interacted to go back to the forecast for a previously searched city.

The Deployed Weather Dashboard can be accessed using the following link: https://arfinxx.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

1. Enter the name of a city in the search bar on the left.
2. Click search.
3. The 5 day weather forecast will be displayed on the screen.
4. You can search further or use the "history" buttons to make previous city results reappear.
